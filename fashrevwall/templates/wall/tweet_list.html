            <h1>Fashion Revolution Wall</h1>
            <p>
                This is the Fashion Revolution Wall, a collection of your clothing labels to mark Fashion Revolution 2016 and ask 'Who made my clothes?'. By welcoming anyone from around the world to post a photo of their label on the wall, we hope to hope to raise awareness of the true cost of fashion and show that together we can create a more sustainable future for our fashion industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                To submit your own clothing label to the Fashion Revolution Wall, just take a photo of your label and tweet it using the hashtags:
